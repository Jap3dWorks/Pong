# Render System

Render System Should run in a parallel thread, and use a queue to comunicate with Maps (or other system that could be rendered).

Render System also must offer a way to communicate with graphic APIs like openGl.

Render System also should offer a way to connect output systems like Output file, Output Window or OutputStream.

RenderSystem also should be configurable to Discard submitted renders if necessary.
